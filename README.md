# Stock Price Forecast with LSTM

This is a demo repo to demonstrate how to use the famous type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast time-series data of stock price. 

The main difference between RNN and LSTM is in terms of which one maintains information in the memory for a long period of time. Here LSTM has an advantage over RNN as LSTM can handle the information in memory for a long period of time as compared to RNN. But the question is what is different in LSTM than RNN by which LSTMs are capable of maintaining long-term temporal dependencies (remembering information for a long period of time).
